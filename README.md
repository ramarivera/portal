# OpenCode Portal

![banner](/public/banner.png)

> **Disclaimer**: This is a **personal project** and is **not related** to [https://github.com/sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) or the SST team. This portal is a personal-built interface for interacting with OpenCode instances.

A web-based UI for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), the AI coding agent. This portal provides a browser interface to interact with OpenCode sessions, view messages, and chat with the AI assistant.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A running OpenCode server (default port: 4000)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (recommended) or Node.js

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `OPENCODE_SERVER_URL` | URL of the OpenCode server (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`) | Yes |

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set environment variable
export OPENCODE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Run development server
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t opencode-portal .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e OPENCODE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000 opencode-portal
```

### GitHub Container Registry

Pre-built images are available at:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hosenur/portal:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e OPENCODE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000 ghcr.io/hosenur/portal:latest
```

## Overview

OpenCode Portal connects to a running OpenCode server and provides:

- Session management (create, view, delete sessions)
- Real-time chat interface with the AI assistant
- File mention support (`@filename` to reference files)
- Model selection
- Dark/light theme support

## Why This Project?

OpenCode comes with its own official web UI that you can access by running:
```bash
opencode --port 4096
```

However, the official UI is **currently under development** and has some limitations:
- Not mobile responsive
- Limited mobile experience

This project was inspired by my personal need to access OpenCode from my mobile device when I don't have my laptop around. The goal is to provide a mobile-first, responsive interface for interacting with OpenCode instances remotely.

## Use Case

This portal is designed for remote access to your OpenCode instance. Deploy the portal on a VPS alongside OpenCode, then use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (or similar VPN) to securely connect from your mobile device or any other machine.

**Example setup:**
```
[Your Phone] ---(Tailscale)---> [VPS running Portal + OpenCode]
```
